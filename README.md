> [!NOTE]
> If you want to download the file to external storage (like ```/Download```, ```/Picture```), please add the following permission to the manifest. This is required for Android 11+ (see [here](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/manage-all-files?hl=en) for more details).

> [!WARNING]
> Android WebView doesn't support the [WebXR API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals).

> [!WARNING]
> OculusQuest doesn't support some HTML5 input tags (see below). If you want to use them, please enable the ```useCustomWidget``` property of the ```TLabWebView``` class. It will display a widget implemented by this plugin on the WebView instead of the standard Android widget. Below is the status of html5 input tag support by this plugin's custom widget.

> Also, currently custom input widget implemented by this plugin uses javascript and disable pointer event ([```onmousedown```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event), [```onclick```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event)). Please note that this implementation has possibility to cause problem on some website.

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin supports both ```Vulkan``` and ```OpenGLES```, but if you are building an application that uses a ```Vulkan``` graphics API, the Android device must support ```OpenGLES (3.1+)``` as well as ```Vulkan```.
